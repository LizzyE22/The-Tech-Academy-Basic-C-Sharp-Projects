# C# Projects
This repository contains my C# basic projects. Thanks for viewing!

## **Projects:**

* [Car Insurance](https://github.com/LizzyE22/The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/CarInsurance)

This project is a MVC Web Application that is able to take the users input on policy information, and then calculate a quote based on business logic. 
In addition, there is an admin page allowing staff to view all quotes that have been issued, based on the user input.
